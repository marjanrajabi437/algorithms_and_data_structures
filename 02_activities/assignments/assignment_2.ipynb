    "In Assignment 1, I worked through the implementation of a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to identify paths to leaf nodes in a binary tree. My initial focus was on understanding the problem and translating it into a structured algorithm using BFS. I opted for a queue-based approach to handle the tree traversal, ensuring that all levels were processed sequentially, which is crucial for BFS. After implementing the code, I tested it on a few tree examples, analyzing the output to ensure the correctness of the paths.\n",

This led to a productive discussion about how to address such cases efficiently and how it would affect the overall implementation.

This feedback helped me refine my solution and ensure that it was more flexible and robust, especially in scenarios where the input data might not be complete.\n",

    "Overall, the process of collaborating with my partner was beneficial, as we both shared ideas and suggestions, leading to improvements in both our solutions.
